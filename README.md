# KKBox's Music Recommendation Analysis

KKBOX was founded in 2004 and it is leading the music streaming industry in Asia. Its wide Asian-Pop music library contains more than 30 million tracks. The service allows you to listen to your music playlists from all your devices and uses a recommendation system combining matrix factorization and word embedding methods.

Nowadays, user music preference could vary from classical music to the latest hit. Recommendation systems need to predict whether a person will enjoy a new artist or a new song. This is especially challenging when the listener has recently joined the service, since there is not enough historical data. This project will focus on answering the following question:

How likely is that a user listen to a song again in less than a month after the first time he/she has listened to it?

Answering the previous question could help improving retention, and therefore reducing churn. The service could, for example, prepare automatic playlist including songs that the user is likely to play again or suggest songs similar to those ones.
